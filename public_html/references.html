During this time we have developed an extremely good working relationship with Meathway Contracting. Their attitude towards each project, regardless of size, has been both professional and organized. They employ a highly skilled crew who are always eager to help. Meathway Contracting are both creative and flexible in their approach to any problems which may arise and are always ready to accommodate us. The quality of their work is second to none.

                            	<p class="prev-indent-bot">We realized that taking on a project mid-stream is not something contractors like to jump into. Our experience with a previous contractor resulted in fines, and ultimately a stop work order. However, despite all the complications Meathway Contractors took control of what had become a nightmare and gave us a sun room extension that has become the favorite room in the house. Tony, Sean and their crew were professional, prompt and fair in every aspect of their work. They showed up when promised, were up front from the beginning with costs, timing and paperwork and were respectful of our home and property. They communicated with us every step of the way and coordinated all aspects of the project. It was a pleasure dealing with craftsmen who really take pride in their work. We would highly recommend them for work in your home or business.

                            	<p class="prev-indent-bot">I have had the opportunity to work with Meathway Contracting Inc. on a couple of complicated high-end residential projects over the last few years. Their attention to detail and highly skilled craftsmen played a significant role in the success of these projects.

I was particularly impressed, however, by their proactive approach to project coordination and their professional but friendly communication skills.
Not only did the quality and substance of their questions demonstrate an ability to anticipate issues but their willingness to discuss alternate solutions to problems made our working relationship particularly effective. Based on this experience, I have confidently recommended Meathway Contracting Inc. to other architectural offices.

                            	<p class="prev-indent-bot">Meathway Contracting Inc. took the lead role in the duplexing of two small apartments in a 120 year old West Village new-law tenement building to create my home. I think renovation is the real test of a contractor. In this project the least issue was working in a land-marked district, to make it better the building's last right angle drifted long ago and the total size of the project was only 800 sq feet. That does not make it easy; they put 1.5 baths and 2 bedrooms in with no room to spare, or to stage their work. There were lots of issues, mostly unpleasant, from 5 redundant gas lines, some of which mysteriously crossed my ceiling, to a revealed gap between the old ceiling and the roof of four feet. Meathway is creative and flexible, when it became challenging, the principles of the firm came and personally dealt with the most complicated and difficult issues. Hard to explain this, but the quality of their work is a daily pleasure. There is not a wasted inch in my apartment, the doors close like a vault, and the staircase, from one out of level floor to the next seems perfectly right. A really pleasant experience working with a contracting firm that in addition to being organized, dependable and pleasant to work with, has some serious technical skills.
